# DataStructuresImplementation
Project for "Data structures and Computational complexity" course
This project contains implementation of following data structures in C++:

- Dynamic Array

- Doubly Linked List

- Max type Heap

- Red-Black Tree

All of them are implemented as objects.
Every basic operation on respective data structure is commented with explanation of how it works,
Although the comments are in Polish.
Every data structure, when testing in main, has "test" section. After inputing preferred size for the test
you can choose one of the basic operations. After first execution a .csv file will be created, containing time
in microseconds the chosen operation took. It is repeated 100 times, so the file will contain 100 of these times.
